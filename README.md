Is the loaning system that you implemented centralized or decentralized? Point out the demerit(s) of a centralized system.
Answer- The loaning system that I implemented is decentralised as only single entities are involved.
       
       Centralization refers to a setup in which the decision-making powers are concentrated in a few leaders at the top of the organizational structure
       1) Bureaucratic leadership-Centralized management resembles a dictatorial form of leadership where employees are only expected to deliver results according to what the top executives assign them
       2) Delays in work- Centralization results in delays in work as records are sent to and from the head office.
       3) Lack of employee loyalty

Explaination of code:
The code that I have written is a one on one loaning serive where the EMI is calulated based on the amount of money borrowed by the borrower, time he/she will take to repay the loan and the service also asks for a collateral
Person is a class
lender and borrower are inherited classes from Person class
lender1 is an object of lender
borrower1 is an object of borrower
The executable first gives information about the the lender and then asks various questions
You are supposed to give corresponding answers
The simple interest will be calculated based on your answers
The monthly EMI will be the final output along with your information
